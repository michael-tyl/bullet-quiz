## Pitch

Quiz games, like Quizlet, Kahoot, Gimkit, and Blooket, have been on the rise, especially with the advent of the pandemic, as a fun and engaging way to keep students captivated in their learning. However, once the initial charm of these games wears off, they often become stale and repetitive. We have created a new quiz game, with programmatically generated gameplay that's new everytime.

## Implementation

Uses Express and socket.io for networking features

Static version live on https://ragehoot.github.io (does not support multiplayer)

## Notes

Much of the code that does not deal with server connectivity in game.js that was credited to Michael (michael-tyl) was actually written by Sahan (soccerstar) on Michael's computer.
